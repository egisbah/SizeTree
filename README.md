# SizeTree

## About

One and only function - sizes of directories and files under provided root path.
Developing this for my own use.
Mainly to avoid "I am running out of space and don't know what to delete" statemets / questions from family members..
And to have some practice and fun :)
UI is made cringy and tripy on purpose..and laziness.

## Releases

I will try to add stable installers for releases after every merge to master.

## Contribution

Pull requests are more then welcome!
